# What's Deployed?

What's deployed from a GitHub repo on various server environments?

This requires that you have 2 or more URLs that return a git sha that
references which git sha has been deployed.

## Development

You can either do development with Docker (recommended) or with a plain
Python `virtualenv` and `Yarn`.

**Docker**

```
docker-compose up web
```

If it doesn't close properly when you `Ctrl-C` and you get the
"ERROR: Aborting" warning message. Type:

```
docker-compose stop
```

Remember, if you change your `docker-compose.yml`, `requirements.txt`, or
`package.json` you can rebuild with:

```
docker-compose build web
```

**Virtualenv and Yarn**

To install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt -r dev-requirements.txt
yarn install
```

To run the app, first start the backend (note, you need at least Python 3.6):

```
DEBUG=1 SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI='postgres:///whatsdeployed' ./app.py
```

and then in a separate terminal, start the frontend:

```
yarn start
```

This will automatically open your browser to http://localhost:3000/

To avoid hitting rate limits on GitHub's API you can go to
[Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate
a token (without any scopes). How can you set:

```
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=afefdf213840aeb8007310ab05fc33eda51a0652
```

**Environment variables**

If either way you use Docker or Virtualenv you _can_ put all your
environment variables into a `.env` file.

## Deployment

**Really basic for now**.

For the front-end, we check the output of `yarn run build`
as a `build.zip` file. This is generated by running `./bin/build.sh`.
